# Loading Screen
This script creates a loading screen for FiveM. When a player joins the server, the loading screen displays, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a simple, engaging animation while they wait to enter the game. The loading screen can include music and background image.

This type of script enhances the player experience and can be customized to match the serverâ€™s style and identity.
